============

The static HTML files for [Peercoin.net](https://peercoin.net).
The site is hosted on GitHub itself, via gh-pages.

### Issues
Content requests, bugs, etc. are all handled through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin.net/issues). We will try to get to your issue as soon as possible.

### Pull Requests
If you have a simple change to the website, we would ask that you create a [pull request](https://github.com/peercoin/peercoin.net/pulls) instead of an issue. This includes things like link changes, text errors, etc. We can add these to the live site just by accepting the pull, which makes everything easier.

If you don't know how to submit a pull request use these helpful guides:
